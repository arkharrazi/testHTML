# <Prework Study Guide>

## Description

This Prework Study Guide was created for boot camp students to provide a external source of information on topics that we will be going thru during the bootcamp. It will contain notes about HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript and what they are and how they are used when making webpages and other applications that utilize HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. The main purpose of the Prework study guide is to learn how to utilize the 4 languages to create a web application and how to professionally deloy the application onto a Public Github webpage.
