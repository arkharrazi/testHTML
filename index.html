        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li> Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), to give the content structure</li>
          <li> HTML is used to create the structure of a webpage</li>
          <li> An element is a type of content on a webpage. The following element types are commonly used to add content to pages: Text elements, Image elements, Header elements, List elements</li>
          <li> Additional elements are also used to divide the content on the page and to describe the content to browsers and other developers, which consists of: Meta-Related elements, Content division elements, and Semantic elements</li>
          <li> HTML elements work together to build the structure of a webpage and provide a framework that makes it easy for a user to navigate the webpage</li>
          <li> Each HTML element performs a unique role. However, two elements are especially important to understanding how the structure works: the <head> and <body> elements</li>
          <li> The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li> The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li> section elements are semantic elements that define a section in a document that contains thematic content</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li> Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), to give the content style</li>
          <li> There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet</li>
          <li> the most common way to style a webpage is by using an external CSS style sheet</li>
          <li> By designating a class attribute as the selector, we will write new declarations for a new CSS</li>
          <li> Class attributes allow us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector</li>
          <li> Debugging is one of the most important parts of the development process</li>
          <li> A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li> A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>

        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li> Git is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of each version of your project</li>
          <li> Git commands always start with git and are used to save and track versions of your code</li>
          <li> Using Git commands, we can initiate (or create) a repo, add our code to the repo, and view the different versions of our code, which are each stored in a unique commit</li>
          <li> GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that allows us to keep track of our projects inside repositories that are stored remotely</li>
          <li> Using GitHub not only allows us to store our code, but also to easily collaborate with others</li>
          <li> Developers use repositories, commonly known as repos, as folders to store the following: Files that contain code, Files that contain other information about the code, like a README file, The version history for all of the files in the repository</li>
          <li> Repositories can be owned by one developer or shared by a team or organization. Repositories also have the added benefit of making collaboration between developers much easier</li>
          <li> GitHub issues can also help teams to do the following: Track, organize, and communicate ideas, tasks, bugs, and enhancements, Identify bottlenecks or blockers that could prevent work progress, Avoid duplicating work by assigning tasks or issues</li>
          <li> GitHub issues are often formatted with a language called Markdown</li>
          <li> git config --global user.name “[firstname lastname]”: set a name that is identifiable for credit when review version history</li>
          <li> git config --global user.email “[valid-email]”: set an email address that will be associated with each history marker</li>
          <li> git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
          <li> git add [file]: add a file as it looks now to your next commit (stage)</li>
          <li> git reset [file]: unstage a file while retaining the changes in working directory</li>
          <li> git branch: list your branches. a * will appear next to the currently active branch</li>
          <li> git branch [branch-name]: create a new branch at the current commit</li> 
          <li> git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li> JavaScript (JS), to handle logic and allow users to interact with a website</li>
          <li> JavaScript is an object-oriented programming (OOP) language</li>
          <li> var: to declare a variable</li>
          <li> assignment operator (=): to assign specific data to be stored into the variable</li>
          <li> topics variable: contains a string that includes all the topics </li>
          <li> console.log method: used to output a message to the web console by adding an argument</li>
          <li> In order to see the console.log in action, we need use the Chrome DevTools which we will be using throughout this bootcamp and in our professional lives</li>
          <li> To access the Chrome DevTools, you can use the following keyboard commands: for macOS, press Command + Option + I, and for windows, press Control+Shift+I</li>
          <li> A console panel should open either below or to the side of the web page in the browser </li>
          <li> the script.js file is linked within the <body> element</li>
          <li> Control flow is the order which a computer executes code in a script</li>
          <li> Control flow can be interrupted by utilizing conditional statements to control the order in which code is executed or if the code is even executred at all</li>
          <li> an if statement is a way to introduce decision making into our code</li>
          <li> a code using an if statement will only execute if the statement meets a certain condition or is true</li>
          <li> If you want to use more than one condition within an if statement, then you can use the else if statement within the if statement to provide more conditions</li>
          <li> The strict equality operator (===) checks to see if two values are equal, and returns a Boolean result true if the values are equal and false if the values are not equal.</li>
          <li> An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data.</li>
          <li> A for loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over.</li>
          <li> The for loop contains the following 3 important statements: the 1st determines the starting point for the loop, the 2nd determiens the condition, and the 3rd is what allows the array to iterate over each item </li>
          <li> Commenting out code makes it inactive without deleting it, just in case you need it later. To comment out multiple lines of JavaScript code, put /* before and */ after the block of code</li>
          <li> A function is different from a for loop or conditional statement because functions do not automatically execute when the JavaScript file (in our case, script.js) is run. Instead, you must call a function by name in order to execute it</li>
          <li> To declare a function, we use the function keyword and then give our function a unique name followed by parentheses</li>
